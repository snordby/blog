My Windows install has been succesfully been kicked off my main computer. I think I have secure backups of all my files & software and their various customizations. I'll find out later. Onwards.

Right now I have no Windows system to create a bootable USB drive. Meaning no Rufus. Meaning I am officially out of my depth. 
Sure, I can find and have tried following various guides for formatting a USB drive and creating a bootable drive from an image using the terminal on my Debian install, but honestly, I'm reminded why people don't bother doing things the 'proper' way.
I just want to create a bootable thumb drive. I am obviously already aware, that this is a relatively simple action, but I did have to spend half an hour trying to get the drive to format correctly and adding the ISO correctly. 

To be sure, this is due to my own lack of knowledge, but sometimes I just want to go ahead and do the thing I'm actually trying to do, instead of trying to figure out which part of a command I misunderstood. 

In any case, I eventually learned that the Arch Wiki had exactly the instructions I needed. I have a blinking cursor on my screen. 

Root awaits.

## Installing Arch
Installing Arch Linux by following a [friendly guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxeriGuJKTM) was actually not too bad.

Setting up partitions and bootloaders was obscure, but logical. A matter of defining where basic parts of the system belong, instructing the computer on how to read these definitions and installing and enabling necessary drivers, tools and some basic software.
Even if I'm only following along, it's quite satisfying seeing how my keystrokes result in the gradual creation of a functional system.

I followed Jay's steps almost exactly, though I opted out of Gnome and GDM in favor of XFCE and LightDM. But now I have Arch installed!

Too bad I don't remember what I set as my LVM passphrase.
