> Documenting my progress acquiring developer skills.

Starting October 26th 2024 I will be sharing how and why I am taking steps towards becoming a developer. Fundamentally, I have no idea what I'm doing.

Currently I possess the following:
- An unused degree in journalism
- A dead-end customer service job
- Pretty good communication skills
- Some acquaintance with technology used by developers
- Motivation to making a change

Please follow along in the numbered posts, if you'd like to see how this project is going.

## The Purpose of this Blog
Making changes in life can be a confusing and lonely process.
Committing thoughts to text helps alleviate confusion, sharing thoughts alleviates loneliness. That is to say, hopefully I will become more comfortable with making changes by documenting my actions. And maybe others will eventually stumble across these musings, hopefully finding some value in them, perhaps opening new paths and connections.

Its' certainly worth making the effort.
